When using with SEAL v2.3.0-4 you need to first apply the patch `SEAL_v2.3.0-4.patch' to SEAL,
and uncomment the line

	//#define SEAL_EXPOSE_MUTABLE_CIPHERTEXT

in the file SEAL/seal/util/defines.h. Then rebuild SEAL.

To build SealPIR, simply run `make'. It expects SEAL v2.3.0-4 to be installed in ../SEAL.
